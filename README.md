# Certified Professional in Python Programming 1 Exercises

## Motivation

Took the certification as I was curious what a professional certification questions and exams looks like. Used 25 days to prepare for the certification, gave exam and got <a href="file:///Users/dichha/Downloads/certificate_LQUf.ExTF.Bd5D.pdf">certified</a>. 

This is a medium article on what I felt about it if you too are testing the water. 

## Outcome
At the end of completing this course, I felt like I time travelled back to the freshman and sophomore year of my college. Especially the GUI applications!, both tkinter and in college used `c++` too! <b>Yatzee game</b> is still fresh. 

## Directory Structure
The exercises are based on topics covered in the course. 
Command to run the programs:

`python <exercise-name>.py`
